# Documentation and Testing Archive

This directory contains local testing artifacts and session documentation that are not committed to the repository.

## Directory Structure

### `testing/`
Contains test scripts and screenshots from development and testing sessions.

- **`scripts/`** - Test automation scripts (Puppeteer, etc.)
- **`screenshots/`** - Screenshots from manual and automated testing

### `sessions/`
Contains session-specific documentation and notes from development work.

- **`authentication/`** - OAuth and authentication testing documentation

## Note

These directories are excluded from git via `.gitignore`. They are kept locally for reference but don't clutter the main repository.

If you need to share specific test results or documentation, move them to the main documentation structure or create a proper docs section in the repository.
