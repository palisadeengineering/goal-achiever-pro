## WEEK 1: Vision & Goals

### Day 1 - SMART Vision Framework

**Caption:**

Most people set goals.

Top performers set SMART Visions.

The difference? A goal is a wish. A SMART Vision is a GPS coordinate.

Here's the framework that changed everything for me:

S - Specific (What exactly do you want?)
M - Measurable (How will you know you got it?)
A - Achievable (Is it realistic with stretch?)
R - Relevant (Does it align with your bigger picture?)
T - Time-bound (By when?)

"I want to grow my business" becomes:

"I will reach $500K ARR by December 31, 2025, by launching 2 new products and growing my team to 5 people."

One is a dream. The other is a destination.

What's your SMART Vision for this year?

### Day 2 - 300% Rule

**Caption:**

Your goals are only as strong as your weakest link.

I learned this the hard way after failing at the same goal 3 years in a row.

Then I discovered the 300% Rule from Dan Martell:

Clarity + Belief + Consistency = 300%

Here's how it works:

Rate each on a scale of 1-100:

CLARITY - Do you know exactly what you want?
BELIEF - Do you truly believe you can achieve it?
CONSISTENCY - Are you taking daily action toward it?

Add them up. If you're not at 300%, you've found your bottleneck.

Most people have high clarity but low belief.
Others believe but lack consistency.

The magic happens when all three hit 100.

What's your weakest of the three?

### Day 3 - 12 Power Goals

**Caption:**

12 goals per year.

That's it. No more, no less.

Here's why this constraint is actually freedom:

When everything is a priority, nothing is.

The 12 Power Goals system (from Dan Martell's "Buy Back Your Time") forces clarity:

- 3 goals per quarter
- 1 goal per month gets primary focus
- Each goal ties directly to your SMART Vision

Q1: Foundation goals
Q2: Growth goals
Q3: Scale goals
Q4: Optimization goals

The constraint creates focus. Focus creates momentum. Momentum creates results.

I used to have 47 goals on my list. I achieved maybe 5.

Now I have 12. I hit 10+ every year.

Less goals. More achievement.

How many goals are you juggling right now?

### Day 4 - DRIP Matrix

**Caption:**

Not all tasks are created equal.

Some make you money. Others cost you money (even if they feel productive).

Enter the DRIP Matrix:

D - Delegation ($25/hr tasks)
R - Replacement ($50/hr tasks)
I - Investment ($500/hr tasks)
P - Production ($5,000/hr tasks)

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

Most entrepreneurs spend 80% of their time on D and R tasks.

The ones who scale? They ruthlessly protect time for I and P.

This week, track your time and categorize every task.

You'll be shocked at where your hours actually go.

The goal: Delegate or eliminate everything below your effective hourly rate.

What quadrant do you spend most of your time in?

#entrepreneurship #delegation #productivity #timemanagement #leadership

### Day 5 - DRIP Deep Dive

**Caption:**

Yesterday I introduced the DRIP Matrix.

Today, let's get specific.

Every task you do falls into one of these quadrants. Here's how to categorize them:

D - DELEGATION ($25/hr)
• Email management
• Data entry
• Scheduling
• Basic admin
• Research tasks

R - REPLACEMENT ($50/hr)
• Customer support
• Bookkeeping
• Social media posting
• Content formatting
• Basic reporting

I - INVESTMENT ($500/hr)
• Building systems
• Creating SOPs
• Training team members
• Process optimization
• Strategic planning

P - PRODUCTION ($5,000/hr)
• Closing deals
• High-level partnerships
• Vision and strategy
• Key hiring decisions
• Revenue-generating activities

Here's the exercise:

Track your time for one week. At the end of each day, put every task in a quadrant.

Most people discover they spend 70%+ of their time in D and R.

The goal? Flip that ratio.

80% in I and P. 20% in D and R (that you're actively delegating).

What would change if you spent 80% of your time on $500+/hr activities?

### Day 7 - Week 1 Recap

**Caption:**

Week 1 complete.

Here's everything we covered - your foundation for achieving any goal:

01 | SMART VISION
Your GPS coordinates. Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. Not a wish - a destination.

02 | 300% RULE
Clarity + Belief + Consistency = 300%. Your lowest score is your biggest bottleneck.

03 | 12 POWER GOALS
3 goals per quarter. Forced focus. The constraint creates the results.

04 | DRIP MATRIX
D ($25/hr) → R ($50/hr) → I ($500/hr) → P ($5,000/hr)
Know your task values. Protect your high-value time.

If you implemented just ONE of these this week, you're ahead of 90% of people who just read and move on.

Next week: Time & Energy tracking systems.

We're going from theory to tactical.

Which of these four concepts resonated most with you?

#productivity #goalsetting #entrepreneurship #weeklyreview #success

## WEEK 2: Time & Energy

### Day 8 - Time Tracking

**Caption:**

"I don't have time."

That's what I used to say. Every day.

Then I tracked my time in 15-minute blocks for 2 weeks.

What I found was brutal:

- 3 hours daily on "quick" email checks
- 2 hours in meetings that could've been async
- 90 minutes of context-switching between tasks

I wasn't lacking time. I was leaking it.

15-minute tracking sounds tedious. It is. But it's also the fastest way to find 10+ hours per week you didn't know you had.

Here's how to start:

1. Set a timer for every 15 minutes
2. Log what you just did (1 word is fine)
3. Do this for 2 weeks straight
4. Review and categorize using the DRIP Matrix

The awareness alone changes behavior.

Have you ever tracked your time at this level?

### Day 9 - Energy Tracking

**Caption:**

Time management is a myth.

Energy management is the real game.

You could have 4 hours of "work time" but if your energy is at a 2/10, you'll produce less than 1 focused hour at 9/10.

That's why I track energy alongside time:

Every time block gets an energy rating (1-10):
- What was my energy before?
- What was my energy after?
- What drained me vs. energized me?

After 2 weeks, patterns emerge:

- Mornings 6-9am: Peak energy (9/10)
- Post-lunch 1-3pm: Energy crater (4/10)
- Calls with certain people: Always draining
- Deep work on projects: Always energizing

Now I schedule my most important work during peak energy.

Low-energy tasks get relegated to energy valleys.

Same hours. Completely different output.

When is your peak energy time?

### Day 10 - Daily MINs

**Caption:**

3 things per day.

That's the entire system.

MINs = Most Important Next Steps

Not your to-do list. Not everything that needs doing.

The 3 things that, if completed, would make today a win regardless of what else happens.

Here's the key: Set them the night before.

When you wake up, your brain shouldn't be deciding what matters. That decision should already be made.

The morning is for execution, not planning.

My MINs today:
1. Finish Q1 investor update
2. Review and approve new hire offer
3. Record podcast episode

Everything else is bonus.

This simple practice has done more for my productivity than any app, system, or hack.

What are your 3 MINs for tomorrow?

### Day 11 - App Reveal

**Caption:**

I read "Buy Back Your Time" by Dan Martell 18 months ago.

It changed how I work.

But implementing all the systems manually? Spreadsheets, journals, apps that don't talk to each other...

So I built the thing.

Goal Achiever Pro takes everything from the book and puts it in one place:

- SMART Vision creation with the 300% Rule
- 12 Power Goals with quarterly planning
- Time tracking with DRIP categorization
- Daily MINs scheduling
- Morning and evening routine builders
- 3x daily review system
- Energy tracking and analytics

This isn't another productivity app.

It's the system from the book, digitized.

Building in public. Sharing the journey.

If you've read "Buy Back Your Time" - what was your biggest takeaway?

### Day 12 - 300% Rule Deep Dive

**Caption:**

On Day 2, I introduced the 300% Rule.

Today, let's actually use it.

Clarity + Belief + Consistency = 300%

Rate yourself honestly on each (0-100):

CLARITY (How specific is your goal?)
• 20% = "I want to be successful"
• 40% = "I want to grow my business"
• 60% = "I want to double revenue"
• 80% = "I want $500K ARR by December"
• 100% = "$1M ARR via 500 customers at $167/mo by Dec 31, 2025"

BELIEF (Do you believe you'll achieve it?)
• 20% = "Impossible for someone like me"
• 40% = "Maybe if everything goes right"
• 60% = "I think I can do it"
• 80% = "I'm confident I'll get there"
• 100% = "It's not IF, but WHEN"

CONSISTENCY (How often do you take action?)
• 20% = "I think about it sometimes"
• 40% = "Weekly effort when motivated"
• 60% = "Daily thought, occasional action"
• 80% = "Daily action, some gaps"
• 100% = "Non-negotiable daily execution"

Add your scores: ___/300

Your lowest score? That's your bottleneck.

Most people have high clarity but low belief.
Or high belief but low consistency.
Or they're consistently working on the wrong things (low clarity).

The breakthrough comes when all three hit 80+.

What's your current score?

### Day 14 - Week 2 Recap

**Caption:**

Week 2 complete.

This week was about getting tactical with your time and energy:

08 | 15-MINUTE TIME TRACKING
Track every 15 minutes for 2 weeks. Find the 10+ hidden hours you didn't know you had.

09 | ENERGY TRACKING
Rate your energy (1-10) throughout the day. Schedule important work during peaks, not valleys.

10 | DAILY MINs
3 Most Important Next Steps. Set them the night before. Morning is for execution, not decisions.

11 | GOAL ACHIEVER PRO
The system from "Buy Back Your Time," digitized. Everything in one place.

12 | 300% DEEP DIVE
Clarity + Belief + Consistency. Your lowest score is your biggest opportunity.

If you've been following along, you now have:
- A SMART Vision with 300% scoring
- 12 Power Goals mapped to quarters
- Time tracking revealing your true patterns
- Energy data showing your peak hours
- Daily MINs focusing your effort

Next week: Routines & Systems.

We're going to lock these practices into automatic daily habits.

What was your biggest insight from Week 2?

## WEEK 3: Routines & Systems

### Day 15 - Morning Routine

**Caption:**

The first 2 hours determine the next 14.

I've refined my morning routine over 3 years. Here's what stuck:

5:30 - Wake up. No phone. (This is non-negotiable)
5:40 - Journal: 3 gratitudes + 1 intention
6:00 - Deep work on MIN #1 (90 uninterrupted minutes)
7:30 - Workout (30 min)
8:00 - Shower, breakfast
8:30 - NOW check email and Slack

The key insight: The morning is the only time you fully control.

By 9am, other people's priorities start flooding in. Emails. Slacks. "Quick calls."

If you don't own your morning, you'll never own your day.

I've tried checking email first thing. I've tried "just 5 minutes" of social media.

It never works. The reactive mode takes over.

Protect the morning. Win the day.

What does your first 2 hours look like?

### Day 16 - Shutdown Ritual

**Caption:**

The most productive thing I do all day happens at 5:30pm.

It's not a power move or a productivity hack.

It's a 15-minute shutdown ritual that lets me actually relax.

Here's the sequence:

1. REVIEW (3 min) - What got done? What didn't?
2. CAPTURE (4 min) - Write down every open loop in my head
3. SET (4 min) - Choose tomorrow's 3 MINs
4. CHECK (2 min) - Confirm tomorrow's calendar
5. SHUTDOWN (2 min) - Say out loud: "Workday complete."

That last step sounds silly. It's not.

Your brain doesn't have an off switch. But you can create one.

The verbal cue signals to your subconscious: we're done thinking about work.

No more "I should check one more email" at dinner.
No more 2am anxiety about forgotten tasks.

Everything is captured. Tomorrow is planned. Permission to rest: granted.

Do you have a shutdown ritual?

### Day 17 - 3x Daily Reviews

**Caption:**

Most people review their day once.

At 11pm. When it's too late to change anything.

I review 3 times per day. 20 minutes total. Zero wasted days.

MORNING REVIEW (5 min) - 7am
- Confirm today's 3 MINs
- Check energy level
- Anticipate obstacles

MIDDAY REVIEW (5 min) - 12pm
- Progress check: Am I on track?
- Energy audit: How am I feeling?
- Adjust afternoon if needed

EVENING REVIEW (10 min) - 5:30pm
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- Set tomorrow's MINs

The midday review is the game-changer.

At noon, you still have 5+ hours to course correct.

At 11pm? You can only regret.

This 20-minute investment has eliminated the "where did my day go?" feeling entirely.

When do you review your day?

### Day 18 - Enhanced Pomodoro

**Caption:**

The Pomodoro technique is good.

This version is better.

Classic Pomodoro: 25 min work, 5 min break.

Research shows the optimal ratio is actually: 52 min work, 17 min break.

But timing is just the start. Here's the enhanced version:

BEFORE each session:
- Set ONE specific intention (not "work on project" but "finish section 3 outline")
- Rate your energy (1-10)

DURING each session:
- Note every interruption (internal and external)
- Track whether you stayed on the single intention

AFTER each session:
- Rate your energy again
- Log completion status

WEEKLY:
- Review patterns
- When are your peak focus hours?
- What causes the most interruptions?
- Which tasks energize vs. drain?

After a month, you'll know exactly when to schedule what.

Same technique. 10x the insight.

What's your focus method?

## WEEK 4: Leverage & Scale

### Day 22 - 4 C's of Leverage

**Caption:**

The question that changed how I work:

Old: "How do I do this?"
New: "How do I leverage this?"

There are 4 types of leverage. Master them and you 10x without 10x effort.

CODE - Automation that works while you sleep
Software, scripts, systems that run without you.

CONTENT - Create once, reach forever
One video can generate leads for years. One article can rank indefinitely.

CAPITAL - Money doing the work
Hiring, investing, buying time back through spending.

COLLABORATION - Other people's audiences
Partnerships, podcasts, joint ventures that multiply reach instantly.

Every task you do, ask: "Which of the 4 C's could I apply here?"

That manual process? Could be code.
That one-on-one advice? Could be content.
That time-consuming task? Could be capital (hire it out).
That slow audience growth? Could be collaboration.

Leverage is the difference between trading time for money and building something that compounds.

Which of the 4 C's are you underutilizing?

#leverage #entrepreneurship #scaling #productivity #business

### Day 23 - Delegation Math

**Caption:**

Delegation isn't an expense.

It's an investment with calculable ROI.

Here's the math most entrepreneurs get wrong:

Step 1: Calculate your effective hourly rate
(Annual revenue you personally generate / Hours worked)

Step 2: Identify tasks below that rate

Step 3: Find someone who can do those tasks for less

Example:
- Your effective hourly rate: $100/hr
- Task: Social media management, 5 hrs/week
- Your cost to do it: $500/week
- VA cost at $25/hr: $125/week

Weekly savings: $375 + 5 hours back

Annual impact: $19,500 in reclaimed value + 260 hours

The hours matter more than the dollars.

Those 5 hours/week? That's a new product. A sales channel. Family time.

Yet most entrepreneurs won't spend $125 to get back $500.

Because it "feels" like an expense.

It's not. It's the highest-ROI investment you can make.

What task should you delegate this week?

### Day 24 - Friend Inventory

**Caption:**

You're the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.

Harsh? Maybe. True? Absolutely.

This isn't about cutting people off. It's about being intentional.

The Friend Inventory Audit:

List the 10 people you spend the most time with.

Categorize each:

ELEVATORS - Push you higher
- Challenge your thinking
- Share opportunities
- Hold you accountable
- Celebrate your wins genuinely

NEUTRALS - Neither help nor hurt
- Pleasant company
- No growth push
- Comfortable, safe

DRAINERS - Pull you down
- Negative energy
- Time vampires
- Dream killers
- Always in crisis

Now look at the distribution.

If drainers outnumber elevators, that's a problem.

You don't need to end friendships. But you can:
- Reduce drainer time
- Increase elevator time
- Seek out new elevators intentionally

Your environment shapes you more than willpower ever could.

Who are your top 5 elevators?

### Day 25 - Full System Overview

**Caption:**

Systems beat goals.

Goals tell you where to go. Systems get you there.

Here's the complete system I use to achieve more in less time:

THE FOUNDATION:
- SMART Vision with 300% Rule
- 12 Power Goals (3 per quarter)

THE DAILY ENGINE:
- 3 MINs (Most Important Next Steps)
- Time tracking in 15-min blocks
- Energy ratings (1-10)
- DRIP Matrix categorization

THE ROUTINES:
- Morning routine (first 2 hours protected)
- 3x daily reviews (morning, midday, evening)
- Shutdown ritual (15 min)

THE ACCELERATORS:
- 4 C's of Leverage (Code, Content, Capital, Collaboration)
- Friend Inventory (Elevators vs. Drainers)
- Delegation by the numbers

Everything connects:

Vision feeds Goals.
Goals feed MINs.
MINs feed Time Blocks.
Reviews ensure nothing falls through.
Leverage multiplies everything.

It took me 3 years to build this system.

Now it runs like clockwork.

Which part of this system would help you most right now?

### Day 30 - Take Action

**Caption:**

Knowledge without action is entertainment.

Over the past month, I've shared:

- The SMART Vision framework
- The 300% Rule for goal achievement
- 12 Power Goals system
- DRIP Matrix for time categorization
- 15-minute time tracking
- Energy management
- Daily MINs
- Morning routines
- Shutdown rituals
- 3x daily reviews
- Enhanced Pomodoro
- 4 C's of Leverage
- Delegation math
- Friend Inventory

That's the entire system from Dan Martell's "Buy Back Your Time," broken down into actionable pieces.

But information isn't transformation.

Implementation is.

You have two choices:

1. Save this post and move on
2. Pick ONE thing from this month and implement it this week

Not next month. Not "when things calm down."

This week.

The system works. I'm living proof.

But it only works if you work it.

What's the ONE thing you're implementing?
