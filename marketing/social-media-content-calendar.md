## Week 1: The Vision Theme

### Day 1 (Monday) - Launch Week Energy

**LinkedIn:**
> Most entrepreneurs are busy being busy.
>
> They work 60+ hours a week but can't tell you exactly what they're working toward.
>
> Here's the uncomfortable truth: Without a clear vision, you're just trading time for exhaustion.
>
> Dan Martell's research shows that entrepreneurs with written, specific visions are 42% more likely to achieve their goals.
>
> Not vague dreams. Not "I want to be successful."
>
> SMART visions:
> • Specific enough to measure
> • Meaningful enough to pursue when it gets hard
> • Aligned with what actually matters to you
> • Realistic yet stretching
> • Time-bound with real deadlines
>
> This week, I challenge you: Write down your 3-year vision in one paragraph.
>
> What does your life look like? Your business? Your relationships?
>
> Drop it in the comments. Let's make it real.
>
> #BuyBackYourTime #Entrepreneurship #Vision #GoalSetting #Productivity

**Twitter/X:**
> Tweet 1: Most entrepreneurs work 60+ hours/week but can't tell you what they're actually working toward.
>
> That's not hustle. That's chaos.
>
> Tweet 2: The fix? A SMART vision.
>
> Not "I want to be rich."
>
> Try: "By Dec 2027, I'll run a $2M/year business working 30 hrs/week while taking 8 weeks of vacation."
>
> Specific. Measurable. Real.
>
> Tweet 3: This week's challenge: Write your 3-year vision in ONE paragraph.
>
> Reply with yours. I'll give feedback on the first 10.

**Instagram:**
> [CAROUSEL - 5 slides]
>
> Slide 1: "You're Working Hard. But Toward What?"
>
> Slide 2: "60+ hours/week without a vision = expensive chaos"
>
> Slide 3: "SMART Vision Framework:
> S - Specific (not vague)
> M - Meaningful (worth fighting for)
> A - Aligned (with YOUR values)
> R - Realistic (but stretching)
> T - Time-bound (real deadline)"
>
> Slide 4: "Example Vision:
> 'By December 2027, I run a $2M/year coaching business, work 30 hours/week, and take 8 weeks of vacation with my family.'"
>
> Slide 5: "Your turn: Write yours in the comments"
>
> Caption: Stop being busy. Start being intentional. Your vision is the filter for every decision you'll make this year. What's yours? 👇
>
> #GoalSetting #Entrepreneurship #Vision #BuyBackYourTime #Productivity #BusinessGrowth

**Facebook:**
> I used to think working harder was the answer.
>
> 70-hour weeks. Sacrificing weekends. Missing family events.
>
> Then I learned about the SMART vision framework from Dan Martell's "Buy Back Your Time" methodology.
>
> The problem wasn't my work ethic. It was that I didn't have a clear destination.
>
> A SMART vision isn't just "I want to be successful."
>
> It's: "By December 2027, I run a $2M/year business, work 30 hours/week maximum, and take 8 weeks of vacation annually with my family."
>
> See the difference?
>
> One is a wish. The other is a target you can actually hit.
>
> What's your SMART vision? Share it below - I'd love to see what you're building toward.

**Threads:**
> Hot take: Most "hard workers" are just running in circles.
>
> 60 hours/week means nothing without a clear vision.
>
> What's yours?

**Reddit (r/Entrepreneur):**
> Title: The exercise that finally made my 60-hour weeks make sense
>
> I've been grinding for 4 years. Building, hustling, sacrificing.
>
> Last month I sat down and tried to write my 3-year vision in one paragraph. Couldn't do it.
>
> That was the wake-up call.
>
> I wasn't working toward anything specific. Just... working.
>
> Started using the SMART framework:
> - Specific (actual numbers)
> - Meaningful (connected to my values)
> - Aligned (with how I want to live)
> - Realistic (challenging but achievable)
> - Time-bound (real deadline)
>
> Now I can tell you exactly what I'm building and why.
>
> Anyone else been through this realization?

### Day 2 (Tuesday) - The 300% Rule

**LinkedIn:**
> The 300% Rule changed how I think about goals.
>
> From Dan Martell's "Buy Back Your Time":
>
> Your success on any goal = Clarity + Belief + Consistency
>
> Each scored 0-100%. Max score: 300%.
>
> Here's where most entrepreneurs fail:
>
> ❌ High clarity, low belief = You know what to do but don't think you can
> ❌ High belief, low consistency = You think you can but don't show up
> ❌ High consistency, low clarity = You show up but spin your wheels
>
> The magic happens at 300%:
> ✅ Crystal clear on the goal
> ✅ Unshakeable belief you'll hit it
> ✅ Non-negotiable daily action
>
> Quick self-audit:
>
> Your biggest goal right now:
> - Clarity (0-100%): ___
> - Belief (0-100%): ___
> - Consistency (0-100%): ___
>
> What's your weakest link? That's what to fix first.
>
> #Productivity #GoalSetting #Entrepreneurship #BuyBackYourTime

**Twitter/X:**
> The 300% Rule (from @danmartell):
>
> Success = Clarity + Belief + Consistency
>
> Each scored 0-100%.
>
> Your weakest score is your bottleneck.
>
> Thread 🧵
>
> [Thread continues:]
>
> 1/ CLARITY (0-100%)
> Can you explain your goal in one sentence?
> Do you have specific metrics?
> Is there a deadline?
>
> Low clarity = spinning wheels
>
> 2/ BELIEF (0-100%)
> Do you truly think you can hit this goal?
> Have you seen others do it?
> What evidence supports your belief?
>
> Low belief = self-sabotage
>
> 3/ CONSISTENCY (0-100%)
> Are you taking daily action?
> Do you have systems, not just intentions?
> What happens when motivation fades?
>
> Low consistency = dreams stay dreams
>
> 4/ The unlock:
>
> Find your lowest score.
> Fix that first.
>
> No point in 100% clarity if you have 20% belief.
>
> What's your weakest link?

**Instagram:**
> [REEL - 30 seconds]
>
> Hook: "Why your goals keep failing (it's math)"
>
> Script:
> "The 300% Rule from Dan Martell:
>
> Success equals Clarity plus Belief plus Consistency.
>
> Each scored zero to one hundred percent.
>
> Your total needs to be close to 300 to succeed.
>
> Most people have high clarity - they know what they want.
>
> But low belief - they don't think they can do it.
>
> Or low consistency - they don't show up daily.
>
> Quick audit: Score yourself on each.
>
> Your lowest number? That's what to fix first."
>
> Caption: Which is YOUR weakest link? Clarity, Belief, or Consistency? Be honest 👇
>
> #ProductivityTips #GoalSetting #Entrepreneurship #300Rule

**Facebook:**
> Just did a goal audit using the 300% Rule and it was eye-opening.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> Rate yourself 0-100% on three things:
>
> 1. CLARITY - How specific is your goal? Do you have exact metrics and deadlines?
>
> 2. BELIEF - Do you genuinely believe you can achieve it? Or is doubt creeping in?
>
> 3. CONSISTENCY - Are you taking action daily? Even when you don't feel like it?
>
> Add them up. Max score is 300%.
>
> Here's the insight: Your lowest score is your bottleneck.
>
> I realized I had 90% clarity, 85% belief, but only 40% consistency.
>
> No wonder I wasn't hitting my goals - I wasn't showing up reliably.
>
> What's your breakdown? Share in the comments!

**Threads:**
> 300% Rule quick audit:
>
> Clarity: ___/100
> Belief: ___/100
> Consistency: ___/100
>
> Your lowest score = what to fix first
>
> What's yours?

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - Power Goals Introduction

**LinkedIn:**
> 12 Power Goals. 4 Quarters. 1 Year of Transformation.
>
> Here's why most annual planning fails:
>
> People set vague yearly goals, then forget about them by February.
>
> Dan Martell's Power Goals system is different:
>
> Instead of 1 massive goal, you set 12 projects:
> • 3 projects per quarter
> • Each takes 6-8 weeks
> • Each moves you toward your vision
>
> Why 12?
>
> ✅ Small enough to complete
> ✅ Big enough to matter
> ✅ Frequent enough to build momentum
>
> Example for a coaching business:
>
> Q1:
> 1. Launch group coaching program
> 2. Build email list to 5,000
> 3. Create signature framework
>
> Q2:
> 4. Hire first VA
> 5. Launch podcast
> 6. Develop referral system
>
> [Continue for Q3, Q4]
>
> Each Power Goal gets:
> • Monthly targets
> • Weekly targets
> • Daily actions
>
> That's how dreams become reality.
>
> What would YOUR 12 Power Goals be?
>
> #GoalSetting #AnnualPlanning #Entrepreneurship #PowerGoals

**Twitter/X:**
> Forget "New Year's Resolutions."
>
> Try 12 Power Goals instead:
>
> • 3 per quarter
> • 6-8 weeks each
> • Each one moves the needle
>
> Small enough to finish. Big enough to matter.
>
> What's your Q1 Power Goal #1?

**Instagram:**
> [CAROUSEL - 6 slides]
>
> Slide 1: "Why 12 Power Goals > 1 Big Resolution"
>
> Slide 2: "The Problem:
> January 1: 'This is my year!'
> February 1: 'What was my goal again?'"
>
> Slide 3: "The Solution: 12 Power Goals
> • 3 per quarter
> • 6-8 weeks each
> • Clear start & end"
>
> Slide 4: "Example Q1:
> 1. Launch group program
> 2. Build list to 5,000
> 3. Create signature framework"
>
> Slide 5: "Each Power Goal breaks down:
> Vision → Power Goal → Monthly → Weekly → Daily"
>
> Slide 6: "Save this & plan your 12 👆"
>
> Caption: One resolution = one chance to fail. Twelve Power Goals = twelve chances to win. Which system sounds better? Share your Q1 goals below!
>
> #PowerGoals #GoalSetting #Productivity #AnnualPlanning

**Facebook:**
> Can I share why New Year's resolutions don't work?
>
> It's not because you lack willpower. It's because the system is broken.
>
> One big goal for 365 days = too vague, too distant, too easy to forget.
>
> The alternative: 12 Power Goals
>
> Instead of "grow my business," you have:
>
> Q1:
> - Launch group coaching (8 weeks)
> - Hit 5,000 email subscribers (6 weeks)
> - Create signature framework (6 weeks)
>
> Q2, Q3, Q4: [three more specific projects each]
>
> Every 6-8 weeks, you complete something. You celebrate. You build momentum.
>
> By December, you've shipped 12 meaningful projects instead of abandoning 1 vague dream.
>
> What would your first Power Goal be?

**Threads:**
> The math of 12 Power Goals:
>
> 12 projects ÷ 4 quarters = 3 per quarter
>
> 3 projects × 6-8 weeks = perfectly paced
>
> 12 wins per year > 1 abandoned resolution

### Day 4 (Thursday) - DRIP Matrix Introduction

**LinkedIn:**
> Not all work is created equal.
>
> The DRIP Matrix helps you categorize every task:
>
> 🔴 D - Delegation
> Tasks that drain you. Someone else could (and should) do them.
> Example: Email management, scheduling, data entry
>
> 🟡 R - Replacement
> Tasks you're good at but shouldn't be doing.
> Example: Bookkeeping, social media posting, customer support
>
> 🟢 I - Investment
> Tasks that build future capacity.
> Example: Learning, relationships, systems building
>
> 🔵 P - Production
> Your highest-value work. Where you're 10x better than others.
> Example: Sales calls, strategy, content creation (if that's your zone)
>
> The goal:
> • Minimize D and R (delegate or automate)
> • Protect I (schedule it intentionally)
> • Maximize P (this is where you create value)
>
> Do a quick audit:
> What did you spend time on today?
> Which quadrant did it fall into?
>
> Most entrepreneurs are shocked to find 60%+ of their time is D or R.
>
> That's time you're buying back.
>
> #BuyBackYourTime #Productivity #Delegation #TimeManagement

**Twitter/X:**
> The DRIP Matrix (save this):
>
> D - Delegate (drains you)
> R - Replace (good at, shouldn't do)
> I - Invest (builds capacity)
> P - Production (highest value)
>
> Goal: Minimize D+R. Maximize I+P.
>
> Where's YOUR time going?

>
> #TimeManagement #DRIP #Productivity #BuyBackYourTime

**Facebook:**
> Just did a DRIP audit on my week. Eye-opening.
>
> The DRIP Matrix from Dan Martell categorizes all your work:

> R = Replacement (you're good at it but shouldn't do it)
> I = Investment (builds future capacity)
> P = Production (your highest-value work)
>
> My results:
> - D: 25% (email, scheduling, admin)
> - R: 35% (social media, basic support)
> - I: 15% (reading, relationship building)
> - P: 25% (sales calls, strategy, content)
>
> 60% of my time was in tasks I should delegate or replace!
>
> The goal is to flip this - minimize D+R, maximize I+P.
>
> That's how you buy back your time.
>
> What would your percentages be?

**Threads:**
> Tracked my time using DRIP Matrix:
>
> D (delegate): 25%
> R (replace): 35%
> I (invest): 15%
> P (produce): 25%
>
> 60% of my week was tasks I shouldn't be doing 💀

> The rules:
> 1. Maximum 3 (this is key - forces prioritization)
> 2. Specific and actionable (not "work on marketing")
> 3. Connected to a Power Goal
> 4. Time-blocked in my calendar
>
> Example:
> - MIN 1: Write launch email draft (9-10am)
> - MIN 2: Sales call with prospect X (11am)
> - MIN 3: Record module 3 video (2-3pm)
>
> By 10am, I've usually completed at least one MIN.

## Reddit-Specific Strategy

**Subreddits to engage:**
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/productivity
- r/getdisciplined
- r/smallbusiness
- r/startups
- r/SideProject (for build in public)

**Reddit rules:**
1. NO direct promotion in posts
2. Provide genuine value first
3. Mention app only when directly relevant and asked
4. Build reputation through helpful comments
5. 90% value, 10% (subtle) promotion

**Sample Reddit posts:**

**r/productivity:**
> Title: The time audit that revealed I was wasting 22 hours/week
>
> [Share genuine experience, methodology, results]
> [Only mention app if someone asks "what do you use to track?"]

**r/Entrepreneur:**
> Title: How I went from 65 to 45-hour weeks while increasing revenue
>
> [Share the DRIP Matrix framework]
> [Provide value, engage with comments]
