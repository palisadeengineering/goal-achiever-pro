They work 60+ hours a week but can't tell you exactly what they're working toward.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Without a clear vision, you're just trading time for exhaustion.

productivity research's research shows that entrepreneurs with written, specific visions are 42% more likely to achieve their goals.

Not vague dreams. Not ""I want to be successful.""

SMART visions:
• Specific enough to measure
• Meaningful enough to pursue when it gets hard
• Aligned with what actually matters to you
• Realistic yet stretching
• Time-bound with real deadlines

This week, I challenge you: Write down your 3-year vision in one paragraph.

SMART visions are different:

- Meaningful (worth fighting for)
- Aligned (with your life)

From productivity research's ""time optimization"":

Your success on any goal = Clarity + Belief + Consistency

Each scored 0-100%. Max score: 300%.

Here's where most entrepreneurs fail:

❌ High clarity, low belief = You know what to do but don't think you can
❌ High belief, low consistency = You think you can but don't show up
❌ High consistency, low clarity = You show up but spin your wheels

The magic happens at 300%:
✅ Crystal clear on the goal
✅ Unshakeable belief you'll hit it
✅ Non-negotiable daily action

Here's why most annual planning fails:

People set vague yearly goals, then forget about them by February.

productivity research's Power Goals system is different:

Instead of 1 massive goal, you set 12 projects:
• 3 projects per quarter
• Each takes 6-8 weeks
• Each moves you toward your vision

Why 12?

✅ Small enough to complete
✅ Big enough to matter
✅ Frequent enough to build momentum

Example for a coaching business:

Q1:
1. Launch group coaching program
2. Build email list to 5,000
3. Create signature framework

Q2:
4. Hire first VA
5. Launch podcast
6. Develop referral system

• Monthly targets

🟡 R - Replacement

🔵 P - Production
Your highest-value work. Where you're 10x better than others.
Example: Sales calls, strategy, content creation (if that's your zone)

• Minimize D and R (delegate or automate)
• Protect I (schedule it intentionally)
• Maximize P (this is where you create value)
