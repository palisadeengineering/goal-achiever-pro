## Week 1: Foundations

### Day 1
The difference between busy and productive:

Busy = working on what's in front of you
Productive = working on what moves the needle

You can be extremely busy and accomplish nothing.

Track your time for one day. You'll see.

---

### Day 2
Your morning sets your day.

Win the first hour:
- No phone for 30 min
- Move your body
- Plan your top 3

Everything else is optional.

---

### Day 3
The 300% Rule:

Clarity + Belief + Consistency = Success

Score each 0-100%.

Low total = goal fails.
High total = goal inevitable.

What's your weakest link?

---

### Day 4
Unpopular opinion:

You don't need more motivation.
You need better systems.

Motivation fluctuates.
Systems run regardless.

Build systems. Stop waiting to feel like it.

---

### Day 5
The DRIP Matrix in 4 sentences:

D - Delegate tasks that drain you + pay little
R - Replace tasks that drain you + pay well
I - Invest in tasks that energize you + pay little
P - Produce tasks that energize you + pay well

Maximize P. Eliminate D.

---

### Day 6
Most people's to-do list:
- 27 random tasks
- No priority
- Zero chance of completion

High performers' list:
- 3 MINs (Most Important Next Steps)
- Clear priorities
- Done by noon

Less but better.

---

### Day 7
Sunday reset routine:

1. Review last week (10 min)
2. Plan next week (15 min)
3. Set 3 weekly targets
4. Prep Monday's MINs
5. Rest with zero guilt

30 minutes of planning saves 5 hours of chaos.

---

## Week 2: Time Mastery

### Day 8
Time tracking truth:

Everyone thinks they work 50 hours.
Actual productive work: 15-20 hours.

The rest? Admin, meetings, "research," social media.

Track your time. Face the truth. Fix it.

---

### Day 9
Energy > Time

Stop optimizing your calendar.
Start optimizing your energy.

When are you sharpest?
That's when you do your most important work.

Everything else can wait.

---

### Day 10
The 15-minute rule:

Any task can be started in 15 minutes.

Not finished. Started.

"I don't have 2 hours" is an excuse.
"I have 15 minutes" is always true.

Start. The rest follows.

---

### Day 11
Meeting math:

1-hour meeting with 5 people = 5 hours of company time
That meeting could have been a 5-minute Loom

Protect your time. Protect your team's time.

---

### Day 12
Context switching costs you 23 minutes.

Every. Single. Time.

10 interruptions = 230 minutes lost.

Batch similar tasks.
Block deep work time.
Turn off notifications.

Your focus is worth more than your availability.

---

### Day 13
The delegation test:

If someone else can do it 80% as well as you...
Delegate it.

You don't need 100% perfection.
You need 100% of your time on high-value work.

---

### Day 14
Weekly review questions:

1. What worked?
2. What didn't?
3. What will I do differently?

5 minutes. Every Sunday.

Reflection without action is useless.
Action without reflection is blind.

---

## Week 3: Goal Achievement

### Day 15
Why most goals fail:

Not because they're too big.
Because the daily actions are unclear.

"Get fit" = fails.
"Walk 30 min before work" = succeeds.

Make it specific. Make it schedulable.

---

### Day 16
The 1% rule:

Improve 1% daily = 37x better in a year.
Decline 1% daily = nearly zero in a year.

Small daily actions compound.
Skipped days compound too.

What's your 1% today?

---

### Day 17
Goal structure that works:

OUTCOME: What does done look like?
TIMELINE: When is the deadline?
MILESTONES: What are the checkpoints?
DAILY: What do I do today?

Vague goals stay dreams.
Structured goals become reality.

---

### Day 18
Belief is trainable.

Don't believe you can do it?
Find 3 people who've done similar.
Study them.
Model them.

Belief follows evidence.
Go create some evidence.

---

### Day 19
The accountability paradox:

We're 65% likely to complete a goal if we commit to someone.
We're 95% likely if we have a specific accountability appointment.

Tell someone. Schedule check-ins.

Private goals die quietly.

---

### Day 20
Quit pursuing balance.

Balance implies everything gets equal time.
That's not how achievement works.

Priorities shift. Seasons change.
What matters is alignment with YOUR values.

Not society's idea of balanced.

---

### Day 21
The Sunday advantage:

While others rest completely...
Spend 30 minutes planning your week.

You'll start Monday with clarity.
They'll start Monday reacting.

Small edge. Massive advantage over time.

---

## Week 4: Systems & Habits

### Day 22
Habits > Goals

Goals are what you want.
Habits are how you get there.

"I want to read more" (goal)
"I read for 15 min every morning" (habit)

Focus on the system. Results follow.

---

### Day 23
The habit stack:

Existing habit + New habit = Success

"After I pour my coffee, I'll write for 5 minutes."
"After I sit at my desk, I'll plan my MINs."

Piggyback on what already works.

---

### Day 24
Review cadence:

Daily: Did I hit my MINs?
Weekly: Am I on track for weekly targets?
Monthly: Is the Power Goal progressing?
Quarterly: Does the vision still fit?

Different zoom levels. Different insights.

---

### Day 25
The evening shutdown:

1. Review what you accomplished
2. Set tomorrow's 3 MINs
3. Clear your desk
4. Say "shutdown complete"

Your brain needs closure.
Give it permission to rest.

---

### Day 26
Productivity isn't about doing more.

It's about doing the RIGHT things.

You can be incredibly efficient at tasks that don't matter.

First: Is this worth doing at all?
Then: How do I do it efficiently?

---

### Day 27
The two-minute rule:

If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.

Waiting costs more than doing.

Small tasks pile up.
Tiny completions clear the deck.

---

### Day 28
Protect your mornings.

No meetings before 10 AM.
No email until MINs are done.
No social media until you've created.

Mornings are for output.
Afternoons for input.

---

## Week 5: Mindset

### Day 29
Motivation is overrated.

Discipline shows up when motivation doesn't.

Build the habit.
Follow the system.
Do it whether you feel like it or not.

Feelings follow action. Not the other way around.

---

### Day 30
Done is better than perfect.

That project you've been tweaking?
Ship it.

That email you've rewritten 5 times?
Send it.

Perfection is procrastination in disguise.

Progress > Perfection.

---
