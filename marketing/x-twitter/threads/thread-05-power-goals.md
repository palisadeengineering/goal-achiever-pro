## Tweet 1 (Hook)
I achieved more in 12 months than the previous 5 years combined.

Not by working harder.
Not by setting bigger goals.

By setting FEWER goals.

Here's the 12 Power Goals system that changed everything:

---

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
The goal-setting trap:

January 1st: "This year I'll..."
- Get fit
- Make more money
- Learn Spanish
- Read 50 books
- Start a business
- Improve relationships

By February: Overwhelmed. Nothing done.

Sound familiar?

---

## Tweet 3 (The Insight)
The counterintuitive insight:

More goals = less achievement.

Your focus is finite.
Your energy is finite.
Your willpower is finite.

Spreading thin = accomplishing nothing.

---

## Tweet 4 (The System)
The Power Goals System:

12 goals. 12 months. 1 goal per month.

That's it.

One major project gets your FULL attention for 30 days.

Complete it. Move on.

By December: 12 significant achievements.

---

## Tweet 5 (Why It Works)
Why this works:

1. Total focus (no context switching between goals)
2. Momentum (finish one, confidence for the next)
3. Realistic timeline (30 days per project)
4. Compound effect (each goal builds on the last)
5. Clear deadline (monthly accountability)

## Tweet 6 (Categories)
Balance your 12 goals across life areas:

BUSINESS/CAREER: 4-5 goals
- Launch product
- Hit revenue target
- Hire team member
- Complete certification

HEALTH: 2-3 goals
- Establish workout routine
- Complete fitness challenge
- Improve sleep habits

RELATIONSHIPS: 2-3 goals
- Weekly date nights
- Reconnect with old friends
- Build professional network

WEALTH: 2 goals
- Build emergency fund
- Set up investing system

---

## Tweet 7 (Examples)
Real Power Goal examples:

- January: Launch email newsletter (0 to 1,000 subscribers)
- February: Complete 30-day fitness challenge
- March: Hire and train first VA
- April: Create online course
- May: Plan family vacation
- June: Reach $10K MRR

One thing. Full focus. Done.

---

## Tweet 8 (Structure)
Power Goal structure:

Each goal needs:
1. Clear outcome (what "done" looks like)
2. 4 weekly milestones
3. Daily actions (MINs)
4. Success metrics
5. Potential obstacles (planned for)

Vague goals die. Specific goals thrive.

---

## Tweet 9 (Weekly Breakdown)
The 4-week execution plan:

WEEK 1: Setup & planning
- Research and prepare
- Gather resources
- Define first milestone

WEEK 2: Build momentum
- Execute daily
- Complete milestone 1
- Adjust if needed

WEEK 3: Push through
- Handle obstacles
- Complete milestone 2
- Stay consistent

WEEK 4: Finish strong
- Final push
- Complete goal
- Document learnings

---

## Tweet 10 (Daily MINs)
Daily MINs (Most Important Next Steps):

Each day, identify 3 actions that move this month's goal forward.

Not 10 tasks.
Not a massive to-do list.

Just 3 MINs.

Complete them before anything else.

---

## Tweet 11 (Common Mistakes)
Power Goal mistakes to avoid:

1. Setting 3 Power Goals in one month (defeats the purpose)
2. Goals too vague ("get healthy" vs "complete Couch to 5K")
3. No weekly milestones (waiting until week 4 to act)
4. Abandoning mid-month (finish what you start)
5. Not connected to bigger vision

---

## Tweet 12 (Quarterly Review)
Quarterly checkpoints:

Every 3 months, review:
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- Adjust remaining goals?
- Still aligned with vision?

Be flexible with the plan.
Be rigid with the system.

---

## Tweet 13 (The Compound Effect)
The compound effect:

Month 1: Launched newsletter (built audience)
Month 2: Created content consistently (established authority)
Month 3: Hired VA (freed up time)
Month 4: Launched course (to newsletter audience)

Each goal enables the next.

By month 12: Unrecognizable from month 1.

---

## Tweet 14 (Start Now)
Don't wait for January.

Start THIS month:
1. Pick ONE goal you've been putting off
2. Define "done"
3. Set 4 weekly milestones
4. Identify tomorrow's 3 MINs

30 days from now: DONE.

What's your Power Goal?
