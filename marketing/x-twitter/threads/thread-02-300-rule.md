## Tweet 1 (Hook)
93% of people abandon their goals.

It's not motivation.
It's not discipline.
It's not willpower.

It's a math problem.

Here's the 300% Rule that makes goal achievement inevitable:

---

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Why do goals fail?

Not because they're too big.
Not because you're lazy.
Not because of circumstances.

Goals fail because one of three elements is broken.

Fix all three = guaranteed success.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Formula)
The 300% Rule:

CLARITY + BELIEF + CONSISTENCY = 300%

Each element is scored 0-100%.

When your total hits 300%, achievement becomes inevitable.

Let me break down each one:

---

## Tweet 4 (Clarity)
CLARITY (0-100%)

Ask yourself:
- Can I describe my goal in one sentence?
- Do I know EXACTLY what "done" looks like?
- Is there a specific deadline?
- Can I measure progress daily?

Most people score 40% here.

Vague goals = vague results.

---

## Tweet 5 (Belief)
BELIEF (0-100%)

Ask yourself:
- Do I truly believe I can achieve this?
- Have I seen others accomplish similar goals?
- Do I have the skills (or can I learn them)?
- Does my inner voice say "I will" or "I'll try"?

Low belief = self-sabotage.

---

## Tweet 6 (Consistency)
CONSISTENCY (0-100%)

Ask yourself:
- Am I taking action EVERY day?
- Is there dedicated time blocked for this?
- Do I have an accountability system?
- When I miss a day, do I recover quickly?

Sporadic action = sporadic results.

---

## Tweet 7 (The Math)
Here's where it gets interesting:

Scenario A:
- Clarity: 90%
- Belief: 30%
- Consistency: 80%
- Total: 200%

Result: FAILURE (self-doubt kills it)

Scenario B:
- Clarity: 80%
- Belief: 85%
- Consistency: 90%
- Total: 255%

Result: SUCCESS (all elements strong)

---

## Tweet 8 (Diagnosis)
Which element is YOUR bottleneck?

LOW CLARITY signs:
- "I want to be successful"
- Constantly changing the goal
- Can't explain it simply

LOW BELIEF signs:
- "I'll try"
- Comparing yourself negatively
- Making excuses before starting

LOW CONSISTENCY signs:
- "I'll start Monday"
- Working on it "when I have time"
- Long gaps between actions

---

## Tweet 9 (Fix Clarity)
How to boost CLARITY to 100%:

1. Write the goal using SMART framework
2. Define exactly what "done" looks like
3. Set a specific deadline (not "someday")
4. Break into weekly milestones
5. Identify the first 3 action steps

Clarity is the foundation. Start here.

---

## Tweet 10 (Fix Belief)
How to boost BELIEF to 100%:

1. Find 3 people who achieved similar goals
2. List your past achievements (you've done hard things)
3. Identify specific skill gaps and learn them
4. Get an accountability partner who believes in you
5. Celebrate small wins along the way

Belief is trainable.

---

## Tweet 11 (Fix Consistency)
How to boost CONSISTENCY to 100%:

1. Block specific time daily (non-negotiable)
2. Set a daily alarm/reminder
3. Track progress visibly (streak calendar)
4. Create consequences for missed days
5. Have a "minimum viable action" for bad days

Consistency compounds.

## Tweet 12 (Real Example)
My 300% Score last year:

Goal: Launch Goal Achiever Pro

- Clarity: 95% (specific features, launch date, success metrics)
- Belief: 85% (had skills, saw others succeed)
- Consistency: 90% (worked on it daily, tracked progress)

Total: 270%

Result: Launched successfully.

---

## Tweet 13 (The Secret)
The secret most people miss:

You don't need all three at 100% from day one.

Start where you are.
Measure your current 300% score.
Focus on raising the LOWEST element first.

Small improvements compound.
