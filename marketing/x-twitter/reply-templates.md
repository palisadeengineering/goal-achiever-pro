## Handling Common Questions

### "How do I get started?"
"Start small. Pick ONE thing from the thread and do it tomorrow. Don't try to implement everything at once. What resonated most with you? Start there."

### "Does this actually work?"
"It worked for me and hundreds of others who've shared their results. But you won't know until you try. What's stopping you from testing it for a week?"

### "I don't have time for this"
"That's exactly why you need it. The time you invest in setting this up pays back 10x. Start with 15 minutes. Track your time for 3 days. You'll find the hours."

### "What tool should I use?"
"The best tool is the one you'll actually use. I built Goal Achiever Pro because nothing else fit my workflow, but a notebook works too. System > tool."

### "This seems complicated"
"It looks that way upfront, but once you do it once, it becomes automatic. Start with just one element. Master that. Then add the next."

### "I've tried everything"
"I hear you. I tried dozens of systems too. The difference is usually in the implementation, not the system. What specifically didn't work last time?"
