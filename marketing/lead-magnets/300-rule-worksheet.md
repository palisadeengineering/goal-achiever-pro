# The 300% Rule Worksheet
## Clarity + Belief + Consistency = Unstoppable Progress

*Based on proven goal achievement methodology*

---

## What is the 300% Rule?

The 300% Rule states that achieving any goal requires three elements, each scored 0-100%:

| Element | Question | Score |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Clarity** | Do I know EXACTLY what I want? | /100 |
| **Belief** | Do I truly believe I can achieve it? | /100 |
| **Consistency** | Am I taking action DAILY toward this goal? | /100 |
| **TOTAL** | | /300 |

> **The Rule:** When your total reaches 300%, achievement becomes inevitable.

---

## Why 300%?

Most people fail at goals because one of these elements is weak:

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| High Clarity + Low Belief | Imposter syndrome, self-sabotage |
| High Belief + Low Clarity | Wasted effort, wrong direction |
| High Clarity + High Belief + Low Consistency | Great start, no finish |
| All Three at 100% | **Inevitable success** |
