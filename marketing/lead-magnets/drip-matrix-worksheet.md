# DRIP Matrix Worksheet
## Reclaim 20+ Hours Per Week by Categorizing Your Tasks

*Based on Dan Martell's "Buy Back Your Time" methodology*

---

## What is the DRIP Matrix?

The DRIP Matrix helps you categorize every activity in your life based on two factors:
1. **Energy Level** - Does this task give you energy (+) or drain you (-)?
2. **Dollar Value** - Is this worth more or less than your hourly rate?

| | Low $ Value | High $ Value |
|---|---|---|
| **Drains Energy (-)** | **D** - Delegate | **R** - Replace |
| **Gives Energy (+)** | **I** - Invest | **P** - Produce |

---

## Your Effective Hourly Rate

Before categorizing tasks, calculate your effective hourly rate:

**Annual Income Goal:** $______________

**Desired Work Hours/Week:** ______________ hours

**Weeks Worked/Year:** ______________ weeks

**Your Hourly Rate:** $______________ / hour
*(Income ÷ Hours/Week ÷ Weeks/Year)*

**Example:** $200,000 ÷ 40 hours ÷ 50 weeks = **$100/hour**

> **Rule:** Any task that costs less than your hourly rate to delegate should be delegated.

## Common DRIP Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Delegating P Zone Tasks
**Problem:** Hiring someone for your genius work
**Solution:** Only delegate D and eventually R tasks

### Mistake #2: Skipping I Zone
