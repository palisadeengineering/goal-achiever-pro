"Most entrepreneurs work 60+ hours/week but can't tell you what they're working toward.

That's not hustle. That's chaos.

The fix? A SMART vision.

Not ""I want to be rich.""

Try: ""By Dec 2027, I'll run a $2M/year business working 30 hrs/week.""

Specific. Measurable. Real.",https://goalachieverpro.com,,2025-02-03,10:00,Twitter
"Most entrepreneurs are busy being busy.

They work 60+ hours a week but can't tell you exactly what they're working toward.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Without a clear vision, you're just trading time for exhaustion.

Dan Martell's research shows entrepreneurs with written, specific visions are 42% more likely to achieve their goals.

SMART visions:
• Specific enough to measure
• Meaningful enough to pursue
• Aligned with your values
• Realistic yet stretching
• Time-bound with deadlines

Challenge: Write your 3-year vision in one paragraph.

"The 300% Rule (from Dan Martell):

Success = Clarity + Belief + Consistency

Each scored 0-100%. Your weakest score is your bottleneck.

CLARITY (0-100%)
Can you explain your goal in one sentence?

BELIEF (0-100%)
Do you truly think you can hit it?

CONSISTENCY (0-100%)
Are you taking daily action?

Find your lowest score. Fix that first.

What's your weakest link?",,,,10:00,Twitter
"The 300% Rule changed how I think about goals.

Your success on any goal = Clarity + Belief + Consistency

Each scored 0-100%. Max score: 300%.

Where most fail:
❌ High clarity, low belief = Know what to do but don't think you can
❌ High belief, low consistency = Think you can but don't show up
❌ High consistency, low clarity = Show up but spin wheels

Quick self-audit:
- Clarity (0-100%): ___
- Belief (0-100%): ___
- Consistency (0-100%): ___

What's your weakest link? That's what to fix first.

"Forget New Year's Resolutions.

Try 12 Power Goals instead:
• 3 per quarter
• 6-8 weeks each
• Each moves the needle

Small enough to finish. Big enough to matter.

What's your Q1 Power Goal #1?",,,,10:00,Twitter
"12 Power Goals. 4 Quarters. 1 Year of Transformation.

Why most annual planning fails: People set vague yearly goals, then forget by February.

Dan Martell's Power Goals system:
• 12 projects (3 per quarter)
• Each takes 6-8 weeks
• Each moves toward your vision

Example Q1:
1. Launch group coaching program
2. Build email list to 5,000
3. Create signature framework

Each Power Goal gets monthly targets, weekly targets, and daily actions.

That's how dreams become reality.

"The DRIP Matrix (save this):

D - Delegate (drains you)
R - Replace (good at, shouldn't do)
I - Invest (builds capacity)
P - Production (highest value)

Goal: Minimize D+R. Maximize I+P.

Where's YOUR time going?",,,,10:00,Twitter
"Not all work is created equal.

The DRIP Matrix categorizes every task:

🔴 D - Delegation: Tasks that drain you. Delegate them.
🟡 R - Replacement: You're good but shouldn't do it.
🟢 I - Investment: Builds future capacity.
🔵 P - Production: Your highest-value work.

The goal:
• Minimize D and R
• Protect I
• Maximize P

Quick audit: What did you spend time on today? Which quadrant?

Most entrepreneurs find 60%+ in D or R. That's time to buy back.

7 hours/day of low-value work that FELT productive.
